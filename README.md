# sfml-game-server

This is the server portion which will actually host and run the game.

If you'd like to see what cool (jk) graphics the end user will see, heres the link.

Care to run this? There is a pre-compiled executable in the project

Care to test it? Follow the steps below.

If you'd like to compile on windows/mac in various IDE's, go and check out the sfml documentation, it only takes a few minutes to set up.

<b>Mac OS</b>
 </br> http://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.4/start-osx.php

<b>Windows</b> 
 </br> http://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.4/start-vc.php
 </br> http://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.4/start-cb.php

If you'd prefer not to install any IDE's, I've included a make file which will both compile and run the game.

===========================================================================================

<b>linux</b>

you can run this by first giving permissions, </br>
`chmod +x make.sh`

then run it! </br>
`./make.sh`

<b>Mac OS</b>

Open a terminal and enter the following </br>
`sh`  </br>
Followed by the directory to your file, or just drag and drop the file into the terminal. </br>

<b>Windows</b> <br/>
make a .bat file and copy & paste the contents of make.sh into it.
Run it!

To make this an even awesomer game, I could use some help with artwork, programming, and sound.
